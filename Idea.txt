A text file for each day.
Starting with serial number for ordering, then give a field for things to be done and notify it the next day when we log in.

Also include a diary section with maybe categorisation based on NLP?. Which can be encrypted . Would be damn cool. Please do it mister developer

Things to learn: 
handling file pointers in a stack ds.
Password verification from a database
Encryption of both passwords as well as journal
Using git to keep track of version
NLP to classify days as good or bad.
Possible internet/cloud connectivity (maaybe docker) 
Learn Gui on c. Or do it in python. Maybe a photo each day as well
Check how to make a program run automatically for a new unique file extension

#include<stdio.h>

Int main()
{
 printf("enter username and password: ")
 scanf(u, p)
 If(verify (u,p)==1)
